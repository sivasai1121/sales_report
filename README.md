# Sales Report Generator using Python and FPDF

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to generate a professional PDF report from sales data using **Python**, **Pandas**, and the **FPDF** library. It processes a CSV file containing daily sales transactions, calculates useful summary statistics, and produces a visually formatted PDF document that includes total sales, the top-selling product, average sale value, and a detailed tabular view of all sales entries.

The generated PDF report is ideal for business stakeholders, managers, and data analysts who need quick insights from raw sales data in a clean and printable format.
